### What problem does your project aim to solve?

This year, voting looks a little bit differently. Due to risk of
COVID-19 infections and potential to overwhelm the USPS system with
mail-in-ballots, we want to help citizens understand how to find
drop-off locations for their mail-in-ballots in an effort to ensure
relaibility that those ballots are properly received. Mail-in-ballots
can be securely dropped off at various locations around DC, but those
do not readily correspond to specific polling places, and often those
drop locations have specific dates and times associated with them.

DC BAllot Dropbox assits votes in DC in identify where the closest
ballot drop-off locations are based on their residential address. The
app's main feature is surfacing those locations in relation to a
voter's current location. Additinally, the app will display the
cooresponding date and time those dropbox locations are available. 
Where we can, we'll also provide helpful tips for filling in
mail-in-ballots.

### Who is affected by the issue?

Any voter in the DC area who is considering using mail-in-ballots to
cast their votes in 2020 elections.

### How does your technology help solve this problem?

Yes, currently the information can be found on the ([DC Board of
Elections
website](https://www.dcboe.org/Voters/Where-to-Vote/Mail-Ballot-Drop-Sites)),
but that information is in table form and doesn't easily allow voters
understand the dropbox locations in relation to their current location.

### What was the timeline for this project?

MVP for this project is today - 9/12/2020 during National Day of Civic
Hacking
