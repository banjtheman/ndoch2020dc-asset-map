### What problem does your project aim to solve?

This year, voting looks a little bit differently. Due to risk of
COVID-19 infections and potential to overwhelm the USPS system with
mail-in-ballots, we want to help citizens understand how to find
drop-off locations for their mail-in-ballots in an effort to ensure
relaibility that those ballots are properly received. Mail-in-ballots
can be securely dropped off at various locations around DC, but those
do not readily correspond to specific polling places, and often those
drop locations have specific dates and times associated with them.

In addition to easing findability of dropbox location, we also want to assist voters with finding public transportation options to these dropbox locations. Transportation often serves as of the the biggest barriers to voting in the United States. 

The DC BAllot Dropbox app assits voters in DC with:
- identifying where their closest mail-in-ballot dropbox is located
- the app will display the cooresponding date and time those dropbox locations are available 
- provide closest metro, bus and capiltal bikeshare locations to these dropbox locations

### Who is affected by the issue?

cast their votes in 2020 elections.
